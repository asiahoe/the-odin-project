# Motivation and Mindset

## Introduction
- learning to code is
	- incredibly rewarding
	- but can also be difficult and frustrating
- it takes time to learn

## Motivation
- why do you want to learn programming?
	- fulfilling, well paying career
	- excited by a new creative outlet
	- determined to develop the skills and abilities to build any app
	- start your own company
- my main goals to learn
	- develop an awesome portfolio
	- maintain a blog to further build my audience
	- create browser-based games
	- create community-oriented applications
	- seek more competitive, hybrid design-dev roles
		- design systems
		- creative technologist

## Growth mindset
- fixed mindsets believe
	- if they don't get something on the first attempt, they never will
	- they aren't smart enough to do or understand some things
- growth mindsets believe
	- intelligence can be developed
	- can improve at anything with effort and persistence (grit)
- struggling with something is growth
	- it doesn't matter for how long
	- it only matters that I have the grit and tenacity to see it through
	- embrace the struggles
	- celebrate persistence and overcoming

	- [TED: Believe you can get better](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve)
		- growth mindsets
		- praise wisely; create hardy, resilient kids
		- do not praise intelligence or talent; it fails
		- praise the process, effort, strategies, focus, perseverance, improvement
		- yet or not yet, not pass or fail gives confidence
	- [TED: Grit](https://ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance)
		- grit is
			- a predictor of success
			- passion and perseverance for very long-term goals
			- stamina, and sticking to things to make a future reality
			- a marathon, not a sprint
		- grit and talent have no correlation
			- talented people sometimes don't follow through on commitments
		- grit correlates with a growth mindset
			- failure is not a permanent condition

		- growth mindsets can be taught; they're malleable
		- praise the process, not the talent

## The learning process
- focus mode: conscious focus
- diffuse mode: subconscious connections
	- take breaks to put the subconscious mind to work
	- understand, practice, teach

		- Maybe later. Saved for now.
	- [Ruby Rogues: How to Learn](https://topenddevs.com/podcasts/ruby-rogues/episodes/131-rr-how-to-learn)
		- Podcasts are not my thing.
		- No transcripts.
	- [100 Days of Code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/)
		- The bot no longer exists.
		- The repo is not actively maintained.
		- Biggest takeaway is the log.
		- Don't want the distractions of Twitter.

## What to do when you're stuck
- Google
- take a break
- ask for help in Discord
	- include research
	- what have you tried so far?

## A note on AI code generation
- Large Language Models (LLMs) e.g. ChatGPT
- Generative AIs, e.g. GitHub Copilot
- [CheatGPT: Article by David Humphrey](https://blog.humphd.org/cheatgpt/)
	- Copying generated code will not only compromise what you learn, but may also return unreliable code: "Text returned from LLMs requires an incredible level of discernment and close reading."
	- The answer is not restriction of the technology, but instruction on ethical and pragmatic uses of AI in programming.
- Can result in blindspots and gaps in knowledge.
- Not recommended.

## Managing your study time
- Build a habit of studying daily.
	- specific time
	- specific goal
- Don't focus too much on a deadline, just learn.

## Pitfalls to avoid
- Procrastination: try the pomodoro technique.
- Not taking breaks: performance increases with breaks.
	- Do anything else for a short while.
	- You can still think, or just rest.
- Digital distractions: turn off notifications and block distracting apps.
- Physical distractions: find a quiet place to study.
- Rabbit holes: stay the path.
	- My nemesis.
- Counter productive note-taking: take notes as prompts for research, not direct references. Documentation = notes by somebody else.
	- My other nemesis!!!
	- Like... do I just stop here or what?

## Additional resources
- [Becoming a TOP Success Story](https://dev.to/theodinproject/becoming-a-top-success-story-mindset-3dp2)
	- Don't treat notes as a source of truth or aim to replace documentation.
	- Don't get hung up on learning styles. That's a fixed mindset.
	- Foundations projects not recommended for a portfolio.
	- Spend more time on capstone projects, including Foundations.
